# Understanding Who Responds to Appeals: A Donor Segmentation Analysis Using Python Programming Language and SQL.

This project aimed to construct a model for a non-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom to understand its donors better, make better data selection in the future, and ultimately grow its income. K-Means clustering was implemented to create a segmentation model based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) data to group donors based on their loyalty levels to assist the organisation in identifying potentially profitable and unprofitable donors early on, allowing resources and administration to be focused on more valuable donors.

The project specifically sought to:

1. Develop a segmentation model to group donors based on the recency of their giving, frequency, and monetary value.
2. Find out how each donor segment responds to appeals.

The research looked at data from 2018 to 2021, which included 26,962 unique donor IDs and 87,931 distinct donations.


                                    Results 

**Donor Segments**
The clustering analysis produced three (3) donor segments.

The first segment or group (Segment B) was made up of 6,817 donors.

The second group (Segment A) was made up of 19,211 donors.

The last group (Segment C) comprised of 934 donors.

Thus, the majority of the donors were in Segment A.

**Segment Interpretation**
Segments A (Silver donors/ Lost Donors):
Donors with high recency, low frequency and monetary values. Thus, donors who have not donated in a long time, have a low number of donations and donated a small amount.

Segment B (Platinum donors / Churning Donors):
Donors with high recency and average frequency and monetary values. Thus, great past donors who have not donated in a long time.

Segment C (Gold donors / Best Donors):
Donors with low recency, high frequency, and monetary values. Thus, donors who made donations recently, most frequently and gives the most.


                        Recommendation/ Market Strategy for each donor group

Gold donors:
The organisation needs to learn as much as possible as to why they are so loyal and what makes them happy by setting up interviews with them and analyzing their demographics. Also is email campaigns and rewards.

Platinum donors:
Enhancing communication and explaining how funds are used, as well as asking for feedbacking, can help build confidence and reduce atttrition. Membership and loyalty programmes can also assist these donors progress to loyal and best donors.

Silver donors:
In order to bring back these donors and urge them to donate again, the organisation can provide onboarding support as well as special or customized appeal alerts and re-engagement emails to get these donors who have stopped making donations interested again.

                                   Impact
This project provided information on the loyalty levels of donors and revealed that the organisation has a large number of lost and churning donors.

If suitable measures such as onboarding and loyalty programs, proactive communication and re-engagement emails are implemented, the organisation can recapture the lost donors and prevent the slipping away donors from churning.
